## Public Data from StatsNZ

This repository contains public (mostly spatial) datasets from [StatsNZ](https://stats.govt.nz).

The data have not been modified other than a) unpacking from the ZIP files into the corresponding directories named by the dataset and b) compressing individual large files. The latter means that depending on the tools used it may be necessary to de-compress those, e.g with `xz -d */*.xz` before use.
